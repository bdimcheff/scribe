Usage
-----
1. Check out the general [go docs](https://github.com/olark/supportdocumentation/blob/master/drafts/dev_golang.md) to set up your env first.
2. Put scribe in the proper place in your $GOPATH, probably `src/github.com/olark/scribe`
3. run `make`
4. You should have `scribe` in `$GOPATH/bin` now, which should be in your `$PATH` if you followed the directions above.
5. run `scribe --help`
